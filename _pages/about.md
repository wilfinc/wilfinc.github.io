I am an ecologist with a keen interest in using statistics and data visualisation to inform policy decisions. I am currently working at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology as a Spatial Ecological Modeller as part of the ASSIST project. In my role I combine large volumes of data derived form a wide variety of sources to tackle large scale and complex ecological questions to better mitigate the impacts human society has on the natural world.

Prior to my current position, I worked in Saskatchewan, Canada with Troutreach, the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation, and the University of Saskatchewan. My work was varied and included the design and deployment of a novel freshwater macroinvertebrate sampling tool. During my time in Canada I was also involved in; an international collaborative project investigating the Tiger Salimander (Ambystoma tigrinum) and the salinity of freshwater habitats, quantifing the ongoing impacts of a highprofile oil spill on the freshwater community, and the ecology of forest fire regimes on isolated islands in the boreal forrest.

As part of my PhD, I quantified the impacts invasive species can have on native species communities, through a variety of laboratory, field and statistical approaches. Throughout my academic career I have developed strong analytical skills within the R statistical environment, tacking a variety of data types. I have experience collecting, manipulating, analysing, and visualising data within R. I have authored multiple peer-reviewed publications in addition to other more publicly accessible media and outreach events. I am enthusiastic about furthering our understanding of the natural world through the efficient use of data analysis and visualisation tools.
